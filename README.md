# Shakesearch Frontend

Take-home challenge from [Pulley.com](https://pulley.com/) when interviewing senior software engineers.

Shakesearch (the name of the app) a simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in the complete works of Shakespeare. In it's current state, however, the app is in rough shape. The search is case sensitive, the results are difficult to read, and the search is limited to exact matches.

Your Mission: Improve the app! Think about the problem from the user's perspective and prioritize your changes according to what you think is most useful. The company expect to evaluate submissions primarily based on how well the search works for users.
